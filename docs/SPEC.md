## Overview

Convertix is a media and document conversion utility for Android and iOS.

- **Media tools** run entirely on-device using `ffmpeg_kit_flutter`. No files leave the device.
- **Document tools** send files to a FastAPI backend (Hugging Face, LibreOffice) over TLS. Files are deleted from the server within 30 seconds of job completion.
- **Monetisation** is handled by Google AdMob. Banner ads appear on tool screens. The ad model is non-intrusive and does not gate features behind paywalls.

- No framerate selector in v1

---

### 5. Video Compression

**Processing:** `ffmpeg_kit_flutter` with tone mapping filter chains

**This is the key differentiating feature of Convertix.**

#### Purpose
Reduce file size of large, high-quality video files while keeping quality loss invisible.
Primary target: LOG footage and HDR footage from cameras and drones.
Output is optimised for social media upload and smooth playback on low-spec devices.

#### Supported LOG / HDR Profiles

| Profile | Source |
|---|---|
| Standard | Regular video (no LOG, no HDR) |
| S-Log2 | Sony cameras (A7, FX series) |
| S-Log3 | Sony cameras (A7, FX series) |
| D-Log | DJI drones and cameras |
| D-Log M | DJI newer models |
| C-Log | Canon Cinema, R series |
| C-Log2 | Canon Cinema EOS |
| C-Log3 | Canon Cinema EOS |
| V-Log | Panasonic Lumix, GH series |
| V-Log L | Panasonic (reduced dynamic range variant) |
| HLG | Hybrid Log Gamma — broadcast, iPhone Cinematic |
| HDR10 | Generic HDR10 content |

#### Tone Mapping
All LOG/HDR profiles are tone-mapped to **BT.709** (standard color space for social media, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok) using FFmpeg `zscale` + `tonemap` filter chains.

Each profile has a distinct, tested filter chain defined in `lib/features/video_compression/log_profiles.dart`.

#### Quality Presets

| Preset | CRF | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| High Quality | 18 | Near-lossless visual result, social media archives |
| Balanced | 23 | Instagram, TikTok, YouTube — best size/quality ratio |
| Small | 28 | WhatsApp, messaging apps, email |

#### Output Options
- **Codec:** H.264 (broad compatibility) or H.265 (smaller file, newer devices)
- **Resolution:** Original / 4K / 2K / 1080p / 720p

#### User Workflow
1. Select video file
2. Select LOG profile (or "Standard" if not LOG/HDR footage)
3. Select quality preset
4. Select output resolution
5. Select output codec (H.264 / H.265)
6. Tap Compress

## Document Tools (Backend — Internet Required)

### 6. Image to PDF

**Backend endpoint:** `POST /image-to-pdf`

- Input: JPG, PNG, WEBP, BMP, TIFF — one or multiple images
- Output: single PDF
- Multi-image order: determined by file selection order in v1 (drag-to-reorder in v2)
- Page size: A4, images auto-scaled to fit with aspect ratio preserved

---

### 7. Document Convert

**Backend endpoint:** `POST /document-convert`

| | Formats |
|---|---|
| Input | DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, ODT, ODS, ODP, RTF, TXT, CSV |
| Output | DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, PDF, ODT, ODS, ODP, RTF, TXT, CSV |

- Conversion engine: LibreOffice headless
- Preserves text, tables, images, colors, formatting (best effort)
- Known limitation: complex layouts and custom fonts may have minor rendering differences
- `target_format` parameter accepts lowercase extension string: `"pdf"`, `"docx"`, etc.

---

### 8. Greyscale PDF

**Backend endpoint:** `POST /greyscale-pdf`

- Input: any color PDF
- Output: grayscale PDF
- Preserves all text, vector graphics, images (converted to grayscale)
- No compression applied — output quality maintained
- Engine: PyMuPDF (fitz)

---

### 9. Merge PDF

**Backend endpoint:** `POST /merge-pdf`

- Input: 2 or more PDF files
- Output: single combined PDF
- Page order: determined by upload order
- Backend input size limit: 50 MB total across all files

---

### 10. Split PDF

**Backend endpoint:** `POST /split-pdf`

- Input: single PDF
- Split modes:
  - `range`: split into segments by page range — e.g., `{"ranges": [[1,5],[6,10]]}`
  - `pages`: extract specific pages — e.g., `{"pages": [3,7,12]}`
- Output: single PDF (one range/page set) or ZIP archive (multiple outputs)
- `params` field is a JSON string passed as a multipart form field

---

## File Selection (Phase 5B)

Choosing an input never shows a wall of unrelated apps. Convertix offers only sources that are
installed and can actually supply the required file type.

| Tool(s) | Sources offered |
|---|---|
| Image Converter | Photos (Android Photo Picker), Files, plus any installed Gallery / Photos app |
| Video Converter, Video Compression, Video to Audio | Photos, Files, plus any installed video-capable app |
| Audio Converter | Files and file-manager apps — not Photos |
| All 5 document tools, including Image to PDF | Files and file-manager apps — not Photos |

Guaranteed behaviour:

- The list reflects what is actually installed — an app that is absent is never shown, and an app
  that cannot supply the required type is never offered
- When only one source exists, no chooser appears — the tool opens it directly
- Backing out of a picker cancels quietly; it is not reported as an error
- Selecting a file needs **no storage permission** on any supported Android version
- If a chosen app has been uninstalled since the list was built, the user is told and can pick another

Remembering a preferred source ("Don't ask again") is Phase 5C.

---

## Output Locations (Phase 5A)

Every tool saves its result to a predictable public folder, visible in Gallery / Photos / Files
without the user moving anything.

| Tool | Output folder |
|---|---|
| Image Converter | `DCIM/Images (Convertix)/` |
| Video Converter, Video Compression | `Movies/Videos (Convertix)/` |
| Audio Converter, Video to Audio | `Music/Audio (Convertix)/` |
| Image to PDF | `Documents/Convertix/Image to PDF/` |
| Document Converter | `Documents/Convertix/Document Converter/` |
| Greyscale PDF | `Documents/Convertix/Greyscale PDF/` |
| Merge PDF | `Documents/Convertix/Merge PDF/` |
| Split PDF | `Documents/Convertix/Split PDF/` |

Guaranteed behaviour:

- Filenames follow the `[original]_convertix.[ext]` pattern — predictable, never random
  - Pattern: `[original_filename_without_extension]_convertix.[target_ext]`
  - Examples: `interview.mp4` → Video to Audio → `interview_convertix.mp3`;
    `report.docx` → Document Convert → `report_convertix.pdf`
  - Duplicate handling: append `(1)`, `(2)`… before the extension:
    `interview_convertix.mp3` → `interview_convertix (1).mp3` → `interview_convertix (2).mp3`
  - Timestamp-based naming is removed entirely (Phase 6A)
- The folder is created automatically, including after the user deletes it
- An existing file is never overwritten — ` (1)`, ` (2)`… is appended
- A failed save leaves the source intact; the user's output is never silently lost
- Media indexing is asynchronous, so a new file may take a moment to appear in Gallery

Implementation is `OutputLocationService` over a MediaStore platform channel — see
`ARCHITECTURE.md` §Output File Naming & Placement. Split PDF produces individual PDFs
extracted from the backend ZIP (Phase 5 decision).

---

## Cross-Cutting Constraints

- Media tools: zero network activity, all processing local
- Document tools: files transmitted over TLS 1.3; deleted from server ≤ 30 seconds post-response
- No user accounts or sign-in
- No file contents stored beyond the active job
- Analytics: opt-in only, no PII, no file names or URLs collected
- Outputs are written to public media collections, never to app-private storage
- Output filenames: `[original]_convertix.[ext]` — never timestamps, never random names
- Advertising: AdMob banner ads on tool screens — see §Monetisation (AdMob)
- Conversion history: persisted locally via Hive (`hive_flutter`) — see §Conversion History

---

## File Selection (Phase 6B — Android System Intent Resolver)

All file picking goes through native Android intents fired via the system Intent Resolver (`Intent.createChooser`). The custom Flutter bottom-sheet chooser from Phase 5B and the previous Kotlin BottomSheetDialog designs are completely replaced by this native system implementation.

| Tool(s) | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Image Converter | Intent with `image/*`. System chooser shows Gallery, Photos, etc. |
| Video Converter, Video Compression, Video to Audio | Intent with `video/*`. System chooser shows Video players, Photos, etc. |
| Audio Converter | Intent with `audio/*`. System chooser shows Files, Audio players, etc. |
| Image to PDF | Intent with `image/*`. System chooser shows Gallery, Photos, etc. |
| Greyscale, Merge, Split PDF | Intent with `application/pdf`. System chooser shows Files, Drive, etc. |
| Document Convert | Intent with `*/*`. System chooser shows Files, Drive, etc. |

Convertix implements its own per-tool memory for file sources:
- **First use:** Android native Intent Resolver with app icons and names.
- **Subsequent uses:** If a preferred app was saved for this specific tool, it launches directly. If uninstalled, falls back to the Intent Resolver.
- **Settings:** Per-tool reset available in the Settings tab (e.g., "Image Converter → Files by Google [Reset]").
- **Strict MIME validation:** After a file is picked, Convertix strictly validates the file extension against the tool's allowed format list. If incompatible, a user-friendly error is shown (e.g., "This tool only accepts [format list]. Please select a compatible file.") and the conversion is blocked.

The permission-free property from Phase 5B is preserved — all mechanisms rely on implicit intents requiring no runtime storage permission.

---

## Bottom Navigation (Phase 6C)

The app uses a 3-tab bottom navigation shell:

### Tab 1 — Home (leftmost)
- Existing tool grid (10 tools, 2 sections: Media Tools + Document Tools)
- No changes to tool behaviour

### Tab 2 — History / Active Tasks (middle)
- Two sections: **Active Tasks** (current conversions) and **History** (completed)
- **Active Tasks:** shows running conversions with real progress bar, accurate %, ETA, and Cancel button
- **History:** shows completed conversions as cards, grouped by: Today, Yesterday, Earlier
- Each history card shows: filename, tool name, file size, timestamp, output format
- Each history card has: Open, Show in Folder, Share, Rename, Delete
  - **Rename:** renames the actual file on disk via MediaStore `ContentResolver`
  - **Delete:** deletes the actual file via MediaStore; API 30+ uses `createDeleteRequest` for
    user confirmation; API <30 direct delete
  - **File moved/deleted externally:** show "File no longer exists" inline on the card;
    disable Open/Share/Rename/Delete; show "Remove from History" button instead
- **Clear All History** button at top of history section

### Tab 3 — Settings (rightmost)
- Dark mode toggle (persisted to SharedPreferences, applies app-wide)
- Output folder section: one row per tool showing current output path with Change and Reset buttons;
  changing actually redirects output to the new path, not just updates UI
- Backend status indicator: ping `/health` on settings open; show
  Green (awake) / Orange (cold start) / Red (unreachable)
- App version display
- Open Source Licenses (links to existing licenses screen)
- Clear Conversion History button
- Rate the App (opens Play Store listing)
- AdMob disclosure text: "This app is free and supported by ads"

---

## Conversion History (Phase 6D)

Local persistence layer using **Hive** (`hive_flutter` package — approved dependency).

History record fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | String | Auto-generated UUID |
| `toolName` | String | Which of the 10 tools |
| `inputFileName` | String | Original input filename |
| `outputFileName` | String | Output filename after conversion |
| `outputUri` | String | MediaStore content URI |
| `outputFormat` | String | Target format extension |
| `fileSizeBytes` | int | Output file size in bytes |
| `durationMs` | int | How long conversion took |
| `timestamp` | DateTime | When conversion completed |
| `status` | enum | `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled` |

History is append-only during a session. Entries are removed only when the user explicitly
deletes them or uses Clear All History.

---

## Accurate Progress & ETA (Phase 6E)

### FFmpeg tools (video/audio)
- Real %: `statistics.getTime() / totalDuration * 100`
- ETA: hidden for first 3 seconds; after that: `remaining_ms = (1.0 - progress) / throughput_per_ms`
- Show elapsed time alongside ETA

### Gradio tools (document)
- No real %: show stage labels instead: "Uploading…" → "Processing…" → "Finalizing…"
- Show elapsed time only, no ETA
- Never show a fake progress bar

### Cancel behaviour
- FFmpeg: `FFmpegKit.cancel()` + clean up temp files + remove pending MediaStore entry
- Gradio: cancel the Dio request + clean up
- After cancel: status shown as "Cancelled" in history with no output file

---

## Permissions Onboarding (Phase 6F)

First-launch screen shown once, before the home screen. Dismissed state persisted to SharedPreferences.

Permissions requested with plain-language explanations:

| Permission | API | Explanation shown to user |
|---|---|---|
| `MANAGE_MEDIA` | 31+ | "Allows Convertix to rename and delete your converted files directly from the app" |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | 33+ | "Allows Convertix to notify you when a long conversion finishes in the background" |

If either permission is denied: app still works; a warning is shown inline when the user tries
to use the denied feature. Permissions can be re-requested from Settings.

---

- Password-protected PDF operations
- Subtitle extraction or download
- Cloud sync

---

## v2 Backlog

- Custom LUT import (.cube files) for Video Compression
- Batch conversion for all media tools

---

## Monetisation (AdMob)

**Ad model:** Ad-supported. Free app with banner ads. No paywalls or feature gates.

**AdMob App ID:** `ca-app-pub-2093403233028868~6019383556`
(This is the same App ID from the original v1.0.8 app. The AdMob account must be accessible to retrieve individual ad unit IDs.)

**Ad placement rules:**
- Banner ads shown at the bottom of tool screens
- Ads do not cover the file picker, conversion progress, or result areas
- Ads are not shown during active conversion (progress phase) to avoid obscuring status
- No interstitials or rewarded ads in v1.0.9 (can be added in v1.1)

**Ad unit IDs:** TODO — retrieve from AdMob console (`admob.google.com`) under the existing app. The App ID is known; individual ad unit IDs are stored in the AdMob account.

**Ad initialisation:**
Call `MobileAds.instance.initialize()` in `main.dart` before `runApp()`.

**What the coding agent must NOT do:**
- Remove AdMob from pubspec
- Remove the meta-data tag from AndroidManifest.xml
- Comment out ad initialisation code
- Skip AdMob on iOS
